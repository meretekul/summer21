            All the picture have been taken by our member, except for the header image, which we found here:
            <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/eucalyptus-silver-dollar-white-marble-banner_17848547.htm#page=1&position=4&from_view=detail#&position=4&from_view=detail">https://www.freepik.com/</a>
            <br>
            We made our first assignment a lot more complicated than it maybe should have been, and therefore, thought
            that this one would be easy. We were mistaken.
            <br>
            We made the wireframes in WireframePro: <a href="https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/">https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/</a>, and had our first discussion
            about how different the designs should be between the desktop and the mobile screen versions.
            <br>
            Our first design for the mobile version included a picture carousel, but we found that it was really hard to
            make work without the addition of JavaScript, which we do not yet know how to do.
            <br>
            However, our biggest challenge came when we started to try positioning the pictures with HTML / CSS.
            <br>
            We decided to use flexboxes because weâ€™ve used them before to make a layout flexible. It did however, make
            the positioning a bit more complicated. We ended up with one main container for all the pictures and one
            each for every picture. To make them cooperate presented a challenge, but we did, in the end, make it work.
            <br>
            This is why we ended up, after some searching and testing, with using the &ltpicture&gt element, because it
            automatically scales the images when the screen becomes smaller and the viewport changes.
            <br>
            To make rest of the design compatible with smaller screens and different viewports, we have added media
            queries to change the sizes of the &lth1&gt, &lth2&gt and &ltp&gt elements.
            <br>
            We also had a challenge with our buttons and how to make them look nice when scaled down. In
            the beginning they got clustered together, so we ended up with adding extra code for the
            positioning of them on the smaller screens, by adding it to the media queries.
            <br>
            We have also learned some new skills by doing this assignment. Because our page turned out
            to be quite long, we wanted something that would take the reader quickly back to the start.
            We ended up using a button and the anchor tag in our HTML. We have also used this on this
            page, to help the reader get back to the main page.
            <br>
            To ease some worries, we have run our page through the same checker we used last time, and
            we did not get back any know nor likely problems. We did get one challenges with CSS, turned
            out to be excessive code, which we fixed before turning this in.
