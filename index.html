            <p>The Maltese Luzzu can be traced all the way back to the time of the Phoenicians. And the best place to

            <p>Malta has as many churches as days in the year and they all are special, but the Dome of Mosta is also
                seen as a miracle. During World War 2 the dome was bombed during mess and "by the grace of God" all
                lives was spared as the bomb never went off. The bomb can still be viewed there to this day.</p>
